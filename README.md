# Creating-NumPy-Arrays
An easy step by step look at different applications and techniques with arrays using NumPy

This series of code looks at the use of NumPy as a way to represent data of the same type.  Demonstrated is an ability to create arrays of different dimensions, as well as how to access daat stored within the arrays.  

An important feature of NumPy arrays is their ability to perform array math very easily and efficiently, without requiring you to write lots of code.

The code and examples provided is from the book Python Machine Learning by Wei-Meng Lee
